                    <b class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px; ">Abstract/Introduction:</b>
                    <p class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px;">For my S22 work term I worked at TD Bank as a Quality Engineer intern. 
                        I worked remotely and assisted the QA team with their day to day tasks as I continued learning the landscape. 
                    </p>

                    <b class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px; ">Employer:</b>
                    <p class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px;">TD Bank is a North American based banking company founded on February 1st,
                         1955 in Toronto, Ontario by Bharat Masrani. TD is one of the top 10 banks in North america and aims to stand out 
                         from its peers by having a differentiated brand – anchored towards a proven business model, and rooted in a desire
                          to give back to the customers, communities and colleagues the confidence to thrive in a changing world.

                    </p>

                    <b class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px; ">Goals:</b>
                    <p class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px;">My goals for this work term were straight forward goals that 
                        I had hoped to achieve before the semester ended. As this is my first co-op I really wanted this to be an 
                        experience I will remember and build on. Thankfully I believe I have achieved my goals.
                    </p>

                    <b class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px; ">Goal 1: PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR - Teamwork</b>
                    <p class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px;">My first goal was to get used to working with a team.
                         Working under a direct supervisor and having colleagues was a first for me. 
                         I had worked with others before ofcourse in group projects and such but within 
                         a team the responsibliotes of everyone are important because if one person is 
                         held back the entire team will be. So when I first started I heavily relied on
                          my colleagues to help me with basic learning and teach me what I need to do.
                    </p>

                    <b class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px; ">Goal 2: GLOBAL UNDERSTANDING - Intercultural Competence</b>
                    <p class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px;">Another goal of mine this semester was to improve 
                        on my independent work skills. While I was apart of a team I also had my own responsibilities 
                        and day to day tasks to complete. While learning from my colleagues I wanted to get used to 
                        the environment quickly and complete my tasks efficiently and properly. 
                    </p>

                    <b class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px; ">Goal 3:  CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Problem Solving</b>
                    <p class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px;">This goal builds on my last goal when it comes to independent work. 
                        When working for a big enterprise like TD Bank sometimes it can be difficult trying to solve a problem, at first 
                        I asked my Manager and colleagues if I had any questions but after a few weeks I wanted to try finding the answers
                         myself and not bombard my manager with questions anytime I’m not sure of something. I used all my experiences 
                         up until that point as well as the Agile board the team used to see if any of my questions have previously 
                         been asked and in most cases it has. 
                    </p>

                    <b class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px; ">Job Description: </b>
                    <p class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px;">I worked as a Quality Engineer for TD Bank. 
                        My responsibilities and day to day tasks surmised around testing Migration pages from the 
                        official TD website. I was tasked with finding an defects and issues with the page whether 
                        its code-wise or content wise. If I found any defects I would raise it on the Agile board so 
                        that the developer team can see it and fix it. The tools I used included Eclipse, Word, Excel,
                         Webex, Teams, and more. The main languages used waere Java, HTML and CSS.
                    </p>

                    <b class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px; ">Conclusion: </b>
                    <p class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px;">Overall, This experience and internship was new
                         grounds for me so it was really eye opening to see what it really looks like working in a
                          developer environment and it gave me really good insite on what to look forward to in the future.
                           I think I learned a lot from my own experiences as well as my colleagues and manager’s advice.
                    </p>

                    <b class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px; ">Aknowledgments: </b>
                    <p class="skills__text" style="font-size: 20px;">I wanted to thank all my fellow team members as 
                        they were really understanding and helpful in my learning experience and mostly I 
                        wanted to thank my main People's manager Rohit Kiran who helped me settle with my team 
                        and communicated with Laura and the other co-op advisors to update them with my progress.
